utility.js is part of the theme (accessibility & sticky footer)

The following were included by Renee for decorator widgets:
'jquery.cycle.all', 
'jquery-1.7.1.min', 
'jquery-ui-1.8.17.custom.min', 
'multiWidgets', 
'scripts'
One or more of the above conflicts with the Javascript used by the course_menu block.
